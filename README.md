# week3: University Management System Database Design

This week, you will gain practical experience in designing and implementing a relational database schema. You will design a schema for a University Management System, focusing on entities like Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollments.  You will then translate this schema into SQL statements to create the database tables and populate them with sample data.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

Identify entities and their attributes relevant to a specific system.
Design a relational database schema with appropriate relationships between entities.
Implement the designed schema using SQL statements, including:
Creating tables with data types and constraints.
Defining foreign keys to enforce relationships.
Populate the database tables with sample data.

## Instructions (Read and follow instructions)

1. Answer all questions (text, diagrams etc.) in one Microsoft Word document.
2. Ensure your SQL statements are well-formatted and include comments to explain their purpose.
3. Upload your document on this repo.
4. Share this GitHub repo as your LMS submission link

Design a relational database schema for a university management system. The schema should include the following entities: Student (student ID, name, email, date of birth) Course (course ID, title, description, credits) Instructor (instructor ID, name, email, expertise) Enrollment (enrollment ID, student ID, course ID, enrollment date)

**Implement the Schema:**
Using SQL, implement the database schema you designed. Ensure appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships (foreign keys) are defined for each table.

**Populate the Database:**
Populate each table with sample data. Ensure that there are enough records to demonstrate the relationships between entities.
